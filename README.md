### Axa Assessment (Back-end) ###

As a insurance company we've been asked to develop an application that manage some information about our insurance policies and company clients.

**To do that, we have two services that provide us with all the data needed:**

* The list of company clients can be found at: http://www.mocky.io/v2/5808862710000087232b75ac
* The list of company policies can be found at: http://www.mocky.io/v2/580891a4100000e8242b75c5

**With that information, we need to create a Web API that exposes services with some constraints:**

* Get user data filtered by user id -> Can be accessed by users with role "users" and "admin"
* Get user data filterd by user name -> Can be accessed by users with role "users" and "admin"
* Get the list of policies linked to a user name -> Can be accessed by users with role "admin"
* Get the user linked to a policy number -> Can be accessed by users with role "admin"

**We have the following constraints:**

* REST Web API should be developed using MVC WebAPI
* Think about licenses of 3d party libraries (if needed)
* Authentication and authorization. Take the user role from the web service that returns the list of company clients

As our stakeholders are very fussy, here you have some tips:
* Usage of last technologies
* Solution properly structured
* Usage of patterns
* Add everything you thing it's needed to ensure product's quality.

### What is this repository for? ###

* Visual Studio 2015 Solution (Web API 2). DDD Approach (Repositories, Mappers, Domain Entities, etc).
* Unit Testing (NUnit framework, NSubstitute)
* 1.0

### How do I get set up? ###

* Clone repository (or download source code)
* Restore Nuget Packages for the solution
* There is not database configuration
* Run Unit Tests (HJCS.Tests)
* Check if Web API project is set as Startup Project(HJCS.WebApi)
* Run the solution into Visual Studio
* Use Postman tool (https://www.getpostman.com/) to test the Web API (Or use Fiddler instead)

### Testing the Web API with Postman ###
**API Constraints:**

Get user data filtered by user id -> Can be accessed by users with role "users" and "admin":

* api/clients/**{id}**


Get user data filterd by user name -> Can be accessed by users with role "users" and "admin"

* api/clients/name/**{name}**


Get the list of policies linked to a user name -> Can be accessed by users with role "admin"

* api/clients/name/**{name}**/policies


Get the user linked to a policy number -> Can be accessed by users with role "admin"

* api/policies/**{policyId}**/client
